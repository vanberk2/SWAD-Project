# Checkpoint 4 Report

## Summary of CP goals so far: 

#### Deliverables for checkpoint 2

* working registration ✔️ 
* working session management ✔️
* static versions of all pages (logged out, question, answer, question list, answer list) ✔️ 
* responsive web design ⚠️
* calculate "cost of life" related to simple survey answers (ie, overall) ✔️
* implement some form of CRUD data manipulation ✔️
* store the data in a backing store outside of the web app code itself (e.g. mongodb) ✔️
* include a full test suite for the CRUD functionality that works via a GitHub Action ✔️


#### Deliverables for checkpoint 4

* pass 80% of all tests
* 404 error page ✔️
* progressive web app works offline & tries to sync ⚠️
* passwords are not stored in plaintext ✔️
* calculate "cost of life" related to life expectancy (ie, per year) ✔️
* answers/results pages include pretty data visualizations 
* store history to updated answers
* responsive web design ⚠️

#### Deliverables for Checkpoint 5 (Final)

* pass 100% of all tests
* progressive web app works offline & syncs successfully 
* answers/results pages include pretty data visualizations
* responsive web design 

#### Specialization deliverables ⚠️

Mobile:
* **Responsive web design:** Web pages render well on screens of any size and are easy to use and navigate.
* **Progressive web app:** Users can choose to download the application. They will then be able to answer questions offline and hit a "sync" button to connect back to the server when they want to view results.

### Summary
So far our app is making decent progress. We havent quite been able to reach the goals we'd originally set for our Application last month.
We were able to reach pretty much all of our CP1 and CP2 goals but have fallen a bit short on the CP3 and CP4 goals. Of those that we werent able to complete,
most were from the Mobile and Progressive specializations. Our group member who was in charge of these completed their tasks for CP1 and CP2,
but has not been online for a while and we have not been able to contact them, so Adam and I are unsure of what to do for
those goals since we are not experienced in those fields. This was a bit of a letdown as our most experienced web dev group member is not here to help iron out any kinks our app has.

### Who accomplished what
* Adam was able to setup most of the deployment and infrastructure of our application with the GCP and deployability as well as some of the functions and
program logic such as login/out and credentials
* Uzair did a lot of the page rendering and aesthetic setup of the application as well as some functionailty in the application. He also did most of logistical updates
and documentation work including the readme and reports.
* Jessica did a lot of the initial CP1 and CP2 setup such as static page setup and readme and security setup.

### What didn’t get done in time
 * We werent able to do any of the mobile/progressive specialization goals. There are some areas of our web app where we coudnt quite figure out a speific use case or
 area we'd link a page to just yet, and we arent quite at 80% of tests passed. We also didnt really come anywhere near getting the nice visualizations
 we'd hoped. Goes without saying that COVID did have some part in us missing some of out goals.
 
 ### What functionality remains to be finished for CP5
* Hopefully we'd like to get in touch with ourothe member so we can work on out specializations. As for the other tests, we need to get good
using the MongoDB interface so we can store our credentials and fix out storage issues. We also need to fix small annoyances (Not having an html page linked).

### Who will be in charge of finishing what
* Adam : Main functionality and passing of tests requiring
* Uzair: Passing of tests using MongoDB and database tasks.
* Jessica: Specialization in mobile and progressives.

### What changes, if any, do you want to make from your original plan?
* Of course if we arent able to get out group memeber for the specializations, we wont be able to do those, we also might need to remove the task of data visualization
as our more important tasks that the viz builds on are in progress (storage). (IF we get to this we might need to include another library for Data Viz)
